            Luis Lionel Andres <span class="underlined">(“Leo”)</span> Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the <span class="highlight"> FC Barcelona </span>club and the Argentina national team. At the age of 13,
            Messi moved
            <span class="highlight">from Argentina to Spain</span>
            after FC Barcelona agreed to pay for his medical treatments.

        <p>
          Messi was born on <span class="highlight">June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina.</span> As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age
          of 8, he was recruited to join the youth system of <span class="underlined"> Newell's Old Boys</span>, a Rosario-based club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of
          nightly <span class="highlight">growth-hormone injections for their son</span>, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and
          <span class="highlight">moved across the Atlantic</span> to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style, has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.</p>

        <p>
          On June 30, 2017, Messi married <span class="highlight">Antonella Roccuzzo</span>, his longtime girlfriend and the cousin of his best friend and fellow soccer player Lucas Scaglia. Messi and Roccuzzo have three children together:
          Thiago, born in November 2012, Mateo, born in September 2015 and Ciro, born in March 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          Messi met Roccuzzo in their hometown of Rosario when he was 5 years old. Their marriage, a civil ceremony dubbed by Argentina's Clarín newspaper as the <span class="highlight">“wedding of the century,”</span> was held at a luxury
          hotel in Rosario, with a number of fellow star soccer players and Colombian pop star <span class="underlined">Shakira</span> on the 260-person guest list.
